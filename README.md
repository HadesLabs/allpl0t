# allpl0t
All of my HadesLabs drops are released privately to people I know before I release them to the public. When n0pl0t was dropped, a lot of people [weren't really into the concept](https://ibb.co/zR6p5Sg). Luckily for them, I listen to my user feedback very closely, and my 3rd drop is allpl0t. H3ntai, but it's just the plot.

Unlike n0pl0t, I have no plans to maintain this. What you've got here is all I'm giving you.

All releases will be available for download via AnonFiles. Due to the lack of s_x in these releases, they'll also be available to stream on YouTube.

## FAQ
### What are the original videos?
Ignoring that you could just stop being a lazy f_ck and just search the videos, a playlist of all original releases is available at https://hanime.tv/playlists/ivkvzzwou9zhy01p772w.

### Only 3 releases???
This is a joke project, and won't be maintained. I'm not putting too much work into this one.

### Can I request a h3ntai?
This is a joke project, and won't be maintained. I'm not putting too much work into this one.

### What's the quality like? Are the videos uncensored?
All videos have a minimum quality of 480p. Whether the videos are censored or not shouldn't really matter in this case.

### How were the releases picked?
I sorted by most liked on hanime.tv, and ensured that all videos had the tag "Plot". I also picked out Itadaki Seieki because I knew it had a decent amount of storyline. Don't ask how I know.
